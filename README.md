1) I choose number 1, Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed . 
   I think it will be the best that runs in github since all the people have the same test
   and since the test we can know what is the actully prlblems, it we set test in our computer
   but sometimes it will delete something after test finished that we do not know, it cause problem, 
   it can also help us better to manage the pull request.

2) No
3) No, actully I think the message they want to send user to user, We can not test what actually message  format they want to sent
   also it should test did user has the event of send message when they click send
4) Yes, we can test the max length of message by unit test, because we can easily to write a test for that, and unit test can 
   catch the problems if user achives the max message length
